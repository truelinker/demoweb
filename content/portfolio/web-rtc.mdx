subtitle: "Real-time video communication in heterogeneous periods via p2p."
excerpt: " Now, it is made to develop easily p2p video communication in browser through java script api. What I did as a personal project was to develop an android application by changing the web rtc open source. And communication is implemented between the android native application and the web application developed using the web rtc javascript api."

### [Web RTC](https://github.com/truelinker/webrtc_p2pvideo)
Using the WebRTC open source, I'd modified to implment my own p2p video chat application between the android native app and chrom web app.
> Github : https://github.com/truelinker/webrtc_p2pvideo

## How it works
1. Two peers (Android application and web application) connect to a room created by a server, I used a Javascript web server using node.js and exchange information such as each other's network information (ip, port).
2.  When starting a video call, the call starts by exchanging each other's media information based on the given network information.
