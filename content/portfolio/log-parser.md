### [Log Parser](https://github.com/truelinker/TraceParser)  In order to solve numerous bugs and problems, I need to look at log data generated by many drives. However, sometimes the log amount exceeds several hundred megabytes. In order to save time and effort, I created a parser python script, which is helping me to solve more problems in a timely manner while reducing time and effort.

### How it works

[1] Enter the path of the file where the Enum values are defined.
In the code used as an example, two enum define hpp files are read.

And you can see in the picture below that a numeric enum value is converted to an enum string.
