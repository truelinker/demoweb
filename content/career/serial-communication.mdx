### I developed a serial communication protocol. As for the background, as the tester that uses only a single serial bus was newly introduced, I had to change the firmware to use it with the tester that uses the existing dual serial bus, and I was in charge of developing the fimrware.

The purpose of this project is to change the firmware to work with testers with different serial communication methods on the same firmware. In the existing method, two serial bus lines are divided into TX and RX, and there is no collision between TX and RX. However, in communication using one serial bus line, collision between TX and RX may occur. We had to design the protocol so that collisions do not occur as much as possible, and when an collision occurs, error handling make it return to normal to continue communicate.
