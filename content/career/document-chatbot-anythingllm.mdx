## Project Overview

Implemented a Document RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chatbot using [AnythingLLM](https://github.com/truelinker/anything-llm/tree/integrated_sharepoint) to help engineers at GreenWave Radio quickly search and retrieve information from JIRA tickets and Microsoft SharePoint documents through a natural language conversational interface.

Before this system, engineers had to manually search through multiple platforms — switching between JIRA for project tracking and SharePoint for shared documentation. This chatbot unifies access to both knowledge sources into a single conversational interface.

## System Architecture

The system is built on a RAG pipeline that connects to two primary data sources:

```
                    ┌─────────────┐
                    │   Engineer  │
                    │  (Browser)  │
                    └──────┬──────┘
                           │ Natural Language Query
                           ▼
                  ┌─────────────────┐
                  │   AnythingLLM   │
                  │   Web Interface │
                  └────────┬────────┘
                           │
                           ▼
              ┌────────────────────────┐
              │     RAG Pipeline       │
              │                        │
              │  Query → Embedding →   │
              │  Vector Search →       │
              │  Context Assembly →    │
              │  LLM Response          │
              └───┬────────────┬───────┘
                  │            │
          ┌───────▼──┐   ┌────▼───────┐
          │  JIRA    │   │ SharePoint │
          │Connector │   │ Connector  │
          └───┬──────┘   └─────┬──────┘
              │                │
       ┌──────▼──┐      ┌─────▼──────┐
       │  JIRA   │      │ SharePoint │
       │  Server │      │   Server   │
       └─────────┘      └────────────┘
```

### Key Components

- **AnythingLLM**: Open-source platform providing the chat interface, document management, and RAG orchestration
- **SharePoint Connector**: Custom integration that crawls and indexes documents from Microsoft SharePoint sites and document libraries
- **JIRA Connector**: Pulls ticket data including summaries, descriptions, comments, and attachments for indexing
- **Vector Database**: Stores document embeddings for semantic similarity search
- **LLM Backend**: Generates natural language responses grounded in retrieved document context

## SharePoint Integration

The core contribution was building the SharePoint connector on a forked branch of AnythingLLM ([integrated_sharepoint](https://github.com/truelinker/anything-llm/tree/integrated_sharepoint)). This connector:

- **Authenticates** with Microsoft SharePoint using OAuth 2.0 / Microsoft Graph API
- **Crawls** document libraries and site pages recursively
- **Extracts** text content from various file formats (Word, PDF, PowerPoint, Excel)
- **Chunks** documents into appropriately sized segments for embedding
- **Syncs** periodically to keep the vector store up-to-date with new or modified documents

## JIRA Integration

The JIRA connector indexes project management data:

- **Ticket Metadata**: Issue keys, summaries, statuses, assignees, and labels
- **Descriptions & Comments**: Full text content from ticket bodies and comment threads
- **Attachments**: Text extraction from attached documents
- **Project Filtering**: Configurable to index specific JIRA projects relevant to the team

## RAG Pipeline

The Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline ensures accurate, grounded responses:

1. **Query Processing**: The user's natural language question is converted into an embedding vector
2. **Vector Search**: The embedding is used to find the most semantically similar document chunks from the vector database
3. **Context Assembly**: Retrieved chunks are assembled as context for the LLM prompt
4. **Response Generation**: The LLM generates a response grounded in the retrieved documents, with source citations

## Use Cases

Engineers use the chatbot for various daily tasks:

- **"What was the resolution for JIRA ticket RU-1234?"** — Searches JIRA history for specific ticket details and resolution steps
- **"What design decisions were made for the boot sequence?"** — Finds related JIRA discussions and SharePoint design documents
- **"Show me the test procedure for RF power calibration"** — Locates test documentation from SharePoint

## Impact

- Reduced average document search time from minutes to seconds
- Eliminated context-switching between JIRA and SharePoint for information lookup
- Enabled new team members to quickly find institutional knowledge
- Provided a single conversational interface for accessing distributed project documentation

## Conclusion

The Document RAG chatbot demonstrates how open-source LLM tools like AnythingLLM can be extended with custom connectors to create practical knowledge management solutions. By integrating JIRA and SharePoint into a unified search interface, the system significantly improved engineering productivity and knowledge accessibility across the team.
