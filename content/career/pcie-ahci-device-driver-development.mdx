## Project Overview

Led the development of a PCIe AHCI device driver for a Solid State Hybrid Drive (SSHD) system. This innovative storage solution combines HDD capacity with SSD performance by utilizing a PCIe-connected SSD cache for frequently accessed data.

## Technical Architecture

### System Overview
The SSHD architecture integrates traditional HDD storage with a PCIe-connected SSD cache:

##### Key Configuration Registers

The following table outlines the essential configuration registers used in the PCIe AHCI driver:

| Register        | Offset     | Purpose                   | Access Type  |
|-----------------|------------|---------------------------|--------------|
| Vendor/Device ID| 0x00-0x03  | Device identification     | Read-only    |
| Command         | 0x04-0x05  | Device control            | Read/Write   |
| Status          | 0x06-0x07  | Device status             | Read-only    |
| BAR[0-5]        | 0x10-0x24  | Memory/IO space mapping   | Read/Write   |
| Interrupt       | 0x3C-0x3F  | Interrupt configuration   | Read/Write   |

#### 2. AHCI Port Configuration

Implementation involved the following critical steps:

- Port register initialization
- Command list and FIS base address setup
- Interrupt handling implementation
- Device presence verification

#### 3. DMA Engine Setup

The DMA engine required careful configuration:

- Command list structure initialization
- PRD (Physical Region Descriptor) table configuration
- Memory-mapped I/O optimization

The following table outlines the key states in the LTSSM process:

| State          | Description                      | Key Operations               |
|----------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Detection      | Initial device presence detection | Electrical idle detection    |
| Polling        | Training sequence exchange       | Symbol lock establishment    |
| Configuration  | Link width/speed negotiation     | Capability exchange          |
| L0             | Normal operation state           | Active data transfer         |
| Recovery       | Link retraining/power state transition | Link maintenance       |

### Packet Transfer Protocol

Data transmission utilizes Transaction Layer Packets (TLP) and Data Link Layer Packetss (DLLP):
