## Project Overview

This project focused on significantly improving the performance of Digital Predistortion (DPD) algorithm implementation through ARM NEON SIMD optimization. The optimization resulted in substantial performance gains by leveraging parallel processing capabilities of ARM architecture.

## Technical Background

### Digital Predistortion (DPD)

Digital Predistortion is a crucial technique in modern wireless communication systems that compensates for power amplifier (PA) nonlinearities. The process works by:

1. **Pre-analyzing** the PA's nonlinear characteristics
2. **Applying** inverse distortion to the input signal
3. **Achieving** linear output after PA processing

### ARM NEON Architecture

NEON is ARM's advanced SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data) architecture extension, designed for high-performance computing applications. Key features include:

- 32 dedicated 128-bit SIMD registers
- Parallel processing capabilities
- Support for both integer and floating-point operations

## Optimization Strategy

### 1. Memory Alignment and Data Structure Optimization

To maximize NEON register utilization, careful attention was paid to data alignment and structure:

- **Memory Alignment**: Ensured 128-bit alignment for optimal NEON register loading
- **Complex Data Handling**: Separated real and imaginary components for efficient SIMD processing
- **Contiguous Memory Layout**: Optimized data placement for vectorized operations
